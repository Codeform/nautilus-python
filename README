libautilus-extension Python bindings
====================================

These are unstable bindings for the nautilus extension library
introduced in Gnome 2.6. 

For examples and documentation check the examples sub directory.

Note that scripts are loaded from $prefix/lib/nautilus/extensions-2.0/python

Try to copy test.py to that directory for an example

Requirements
============

Nautilus 2.6.0
Python   2.3
PyGtk    2.4.0

Problems
========
It's currently not possible to reload the python file without
restarting nautilus. That's a planned feature for future versions
