libautilus-extension Python bindings
====================================

These are unstable bindings for the nautilus extension library
introduced in Gnome 2.6.

For examples and documentation check the examples sub directory.

Note that scripts are loaded from $prefix/lib/nautilus/extensions-2.0/python.

As of nautilus-python 0.7.0, scripts are also loaded from $XDG_DATA_DIR/nautilus-python/extensions,
which includes ~/.local/share and /usr/share (or whatever your $XDG_DATA_DIR is 
set to).

Try to copy test.py to that directory for an example

Requirements
============

Nautilus  2.22.0
Python    2.3
PyGtk     2.8.0
PyGObject 2.16.0

Problems
========
It's currently not possible to reload the python file without
restarting nautilus. That's a planned feature for future versions
