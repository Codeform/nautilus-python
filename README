libautilus-extension Python bindings
====================================

These are unstable bindings for the nautilus extension library
introduced in Gnome 2.6.

For examples and documentation check the examples sub directory.

Requirements
============

Nautilus  2.32.0
Python    2.x or 3.x
PyGObject 2.28.0

As of v1.2.0 the nautilus-python bindings can be built with either python3
or python2 support.  Ensure the $PYTHON environment variable is pointed
at your preferred python executable before running configure or autogen.

Running Extensions
==================
As of nautilus-python 1.2.0, scripts are loaded in the following order:

  1. $XDG_DATA_HOME/nautilus-python/extensions (i.e. ~/.local/share/...)
  2. nautilus_prefix/share/nautilus-python/extensions (i.e. ~/Development/...)
  3. $XDG_DATA_DIRS/nautilus-python/extensions (i.e. /usr/share/...)

Simply copy your python scripts into that folder and restart Nautilus.

Problems
========
It's currently not possible to reload a python script without
restarting nautilus.

Run nautilus with the NAUTILUS_PYTHON_DEBUG=misc environment variable to 
print out debug information.
