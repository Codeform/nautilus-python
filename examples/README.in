To try any of the examples, copy them over to:

    @NAUTILUS_LIBDIR@/nautilus/extensions-1.0/python

Then restart nautilus.

Hint: if you're testing an extensions that you're developing, it may
be useful to start a 'private' copy of nautilus, like this:
  $ mkdir /tmp/testing
  $ export TMPDIR=/tmp/testing
  $ nautilus --no-desktop
